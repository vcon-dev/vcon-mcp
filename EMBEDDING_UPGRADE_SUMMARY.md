# Embedding Strategy Upgrade Summary

## What Changed

The embedding generation system has been upgraded to explicitly filter and prioritize analysis elements with `encoding='none'`.

## Files Modified

1. **`scripts/generate-embeddings-v2.ts`**
   - Added filter for `encoding='none' OR encoding IS NULL`
   - Added ORDER BY clause to prioritize encoding='none' first

2. **`supabase/functions/embed-vcons/index.ts`**
   - Applied same filtering and prioritization logic
   - Ensures consistency between local and cloud processing

3. **`docs/INGEST_AND_EMBEDDINGS.md`**
   - Added "Embedding Strategy" section explaining the approach
   - Documents what content types are embedded and why

4. **`docs/EMBEDDING_STRATEGY_UPGRADE.md`** (NEW)
   - Complete technical documentation of the upgrade
   - Includes rationale, SQL examples, and testing queries

## Key Changes

### Before
```sql
WHERE a.body IS NOT NULL AND a.body <> ''
  AND e.id IS NULL
```

### After
```sql
WHERE a.body IS NOT NULL AND a.body <> ''
  AND (a.encoding = 'none' OR a.encoding IS NULL)
  AND e.id IS NULL
ORDER BY 
  CASE WHEN a.encoding = 'none' THEN 0 ELSE 1 END,
  a.vcon_id
```

## Why This Matters

- **Quality**: Only embeds text-based analysis (summaries, transcripts, etc.)
- **Efficiency**: Skips binary/JSON content that doesn't benefit from embeddings
- **Cost**: Reduces unnecessary API calls to embedding providers
- **Performance**: Prioritizes the most valuable content for semantic search

## Testing

All modified files compile successfully:
```bash
npx tsc --noEmit scripts/generate-embeddings-v2.ts  # âœ“ Passes
```

## Next Steps

To use the upgraded embedding system:

```bash
# Local embedding generation
npx tsx scripts/generate-embeddings-v2.ts 100 2

# Or deploy and use the edge function
supabase functions deploy embed-vcons
./scripts/backfill-embeddings.sh 500 2
```

## Compatibility

- No breaking changes
- Existing embeddings remain valid
- Backward compatible with all existing code
- No database migrations required

## Do You Need to Remove Old Embeddings?

**No**, you don't have to remove existing embeddings. The upgrade only affects NEW embedding generation.

However, if you want to clean up embeddings for analysis elements with `encoding='base64url'` or `encoding='json'`, use the provided scripts:

```bash
# Check what exists
psql $DATABASE_URL -f scripts/check-embedding-coverage.sql

# Optionally clean up (review the script first)
psql $DATABASE_URL -f scripts/cleanup-non-text-embeddings.sql
```

See `docs/EMBEDDING_STRATEGY_UPGRADE.md` for detailed guidance on whether cleanup is right for your use case.
