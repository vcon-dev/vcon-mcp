            A Vocabulary For Expressing AI Usage Preferences
                       draft-ietf-aipref-vocab-01

Abstract

   This document proposes a standardized vocabulary for expressing
   preferences related to how digital assets are used by automated
   processing systems.  This vocabulary allows for the creation of
   structured declarations about restrictions or permissions for use of
   digital assets by such systems.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines a common vocabulary of terms for automated
   systems that process digital assets.  The primary purpose of this
   vocabulary is to enable machine-readable expressions of preferences
   about how digital assets are used by automated processing systems in
   the context of training AI models and other forms of automated
   processing.

   The terms defined by the vocabulary can be used to describe, in a
   standardized way, the types of uses that a declaring party may wish
   to explicitly restrict or allow.  Preferences are then expressed as a
   grant or denial of permission concerning each of the types of use
   defined in the vocabulary.  This ensures that preferences can be
   communicated, processed, and stored in a consistent and interoperable
   manner.

   The vocabulary or the preferences that might be expressed do not
   proscribe how automated processing systems obtain or act on
   preferences.  Separate documents will describe how preferences might
   be associated with assets.  It is designed to ensure that preference
   information can be exchanged between different systems and
   consistently understood.

   The vocabulary is intended to work in contexts where such preferences
   result in legal obligations (such as rights reservations made by
   rightholders in jurisdictions with conditional TDM exceptions), and
   in contexts where this is not the case.  It is without prejudice to
   applicable laws and the applicability of exceptions and limitations
   to copyright.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document uses the following terms:

Internet-Draft               AI Preferences                    June 2025


   Asset:
      A digital file or stream of data, usually with associated
      metadata.
   Declaring party:
      The entity that expresses a preference with regards to an Asset.

3.  Statements of Preference

   The vocabulary is a set of categories, each of which is defined to
   cover a class of usage for assets.  Section 4 defines these
   categories in more detail.

   A statement of preference is made about an asset.  Statements of
   preferences can assign preferences to each of the categories of use
   in the vocabulary.  Preferences regarding each category can be
   expressed either to allow or disallow the usage associated with the
   category.

   A statement of preferences can express preferences about some, all,
   or none of the categories from the vocabulary.  This can mean that no
   preference is expressed for a given usage category.

   Some categories describe a proper subset of the usages of other
   categories.  A preference that is expressed for the more general
   category applies if no preference is expressed for the more specific
   category.

   For example, the TDM category might be assigned a preference that
   allows the associated usage.  In the absence of any statement of
   preference regarding the AI Training category, that usage would be
   also be allowed, as AI Training is a subset of the TDM category.  In
   comparison, an explicit preference regarding AI Training might
   disallow that usage, while permitting other usage within the TDM
   category.

   After processing a statement of preferences the recipient can assume
   that each category of use has a preference in one of three states:
   "allowed", "disallowed", or "unknown".

4.  Vocabulary Definition

   This section defines the categories of use in the vocabulary.

   Figure 1 shows the relationship between these categories:

              Figure 1: Relationship Between Categories of Use

   This list of specific use cases may be expanded in the future, should
   a consensus emerge between stakeholders, to include categories that
   address additional use cases as they emerge.  In addition to these
   categories defined in the vocabulary, it is also expected that some
   systems implementing this vocabulary may extend this list with
   additional categories for their particular needs.

4.1.  Text and Data Mining (TDM) Category

   The act of using one or more assets in the context of any automated
   analytical technique aimed at analyzing text and data in digital form
   in order to generate information which includes but is not limited to
   patterns, trends and correlations.

   The use of assets for TDM encompasses all the subsequent categories.

4.2.  AI Training Category

   The act of training machine learning models or artificial
   intelligence (AI).

   The use of assets for AI Training is a proper subset of TDM usage.

4.3.  Generative AI Training Category

   The act of training General Purpose AI models that have the capacity
   to generate text, images or other forms of synthetic content, or the
   act of training other types of AI models that have the purpose of
   generating text, images or other forms of synthetic content.

Internet-Draft               AI Preferences                    June 2025


   The use of assets for Generative AI Training is a proper subset of AI
   Training usage.

4.4.  Search Category

   The act of using one or more assets to build a search index or as
   input to a trained AI/ML model that has the purpose of providing
   search results that include direct links to the location from where
   the asset was obtained.

4.5.  AI Inference Category

   The act of using one or more assets as input to a trained AI/ML model
   as part of the operation of that model (as opposed to the training of
   the model).

5.  Usage

   The vocabulary is used by referencing the terms defined in the
   Section 4 section above, directly or via mappings, in accordance with
   how they are defined in this document.

5.1.  More Specific Instructions

   A recipient of a statement of preferences that follows this model
   might receive more specific instructions in two ways:

   *  Extensions to the vocabulary might define more specific categories
      of usage.  Preferences about more specific categories override
      those of any more general category.

   *  Statements of preferences are general purpose, machine-readable
      statements that cannot override contractual agreements or more
      specific statements.

   For instance, a statement of preferences might indicate that the use
   of an asset is disallowed for AI Training.  If arrangements, such as
   contracts exist that explicitly permit the use of that asset, those
   arrangements likely apply, unless the terms of the arrangement
   explicitly say otherwise.

   The vocabulary does not preclude the use of other specific
   categories.  Any statement of preference based on this vocabulary
   shall not be interpreted as restricting the use of the work(s)
   strictly for the purpose of search and discovery as long as no
   restriction is declared through search-specific means such as
   [RFC9309].

5.2.  Vocabulary Extensions

   Systems referencing the vocabulary must not introduce additional
   categories that include existing categories defined in the vocabulary
   or otherwise include additional hierarchical relationships.

6.  Exemplary Serialization Format

   This section defines an exemplary serialization format for
   preferences.  The format describes how the abstract model could be
   turned into Unicode text or sequence of bytes.

   The format relies on the Dictionary type defined in Section 3.2 of
   [FIELDS].  The dictionary keys correspond to usage categories and the
   dictionary values correspond to explicit preferences, which can be
   either y or n; see Section 6.2.

   For example, the following is a preference to allow AI training
   (Section 4.2), disallow generative AI training (Section 4.3), and and
   state no preference for other categories other than subsets of these
   categories:

   ai=y, genai=n

6.1.  Usage Category Labels

   Each usage category in the vocabulary (Section 4) is mapped to a
   short textual label.  Table 1 tabulates this mapping.

           +========================+===========+=============+
           | Category               | Label     | Reference   |
           +========================+===========+=============+
           | Text and Data Mining   | tdm       | Section 4.1 |
           +------------------------+-----------+-------------+
           | AI Training            | ai        | Section 4.2 |
           +------------------------+-----------+-------------+
           | Generative AI Training | genai     | Section 4.3 |
           +------------------------+-----------+-------------+
           | Search                 | search    | Section 4.4 |
           +------------------------+-----------+-------------+
           | AI Inference           | inference | Section 4.5 |
           +------------------------+-----------+-------------+

                     Table 1: Mappings for Categories

   Any mapping for a new usage category can only use lowercase latin
   characters (a-z), digits (0-9), "_", "-", ".", or "*".  These are
   encoded using the mappings in [ASCII].

Internet-Draft               AI Preferences                    June 2025


6.2.  Preference Labels

   The abstract model used has two options for preferences associated
   with each category: allow and disallow.  These are mapped to single
   byte Tokens (Section 3.3.4 of [FIELDS]) of y and n, respectively.

6.3.  Text Encoding

   Structured Fields [FIELDS] describes a byte-level encoding of
   information, not a text encoding.  This makes this format suitable
   for inclusion in any protocol or format that carries bytes.

   Some formats are defined in terms of strings rather than bytes.
   These formats might need to decode the bytes of this format to obtain
   a string.  As the syntax is limited to ASCII [ASCII], an ASCII
   decoder or UTF-8 decoder [UTF8] can be used.  This results in the
   strings that this document uses.

   Processing (see Section 6.5) requires a sequence of bytes, so any
   format that uses strings needs to encode strings first.  Again, this
   process can use ASCII or UTF-8.

6.4.  Syntax Extensions

   There are two ways by which this syntax might be extended: the
   addition of new labels and the addition of parameters.

   New labels might be defined to correspond to new usage categories.
   Section 5.2 addresses the considerations for defining new categories.
   New labels might also be defined for other types of extension that do
   not assign a preference to a usage category.  In either case, when
   processing a parsed Dictionary to obtain preferences, any unknown
   labels MUST be ignored.

   The Dictionary syntax (Section 3.2 of [FIELDS]) can associate
   parameters with each key-value pair.  This document does not define
   any semantics for any parameters that might be included.  When
   processing a parsed Dictionary to obtain preferences, any unknown
   parameters MUST be ignored.

6.5.  Processing Algorithm

   To process a series of bytes to recover the expressed preferences,
   those bytes are parsed into a Dictionary (Section 4.2.2 of [FIELDS]),
   then preferences are assigned to each usage category in the
   vocabulary.

Internet-Draft               AI Preferences                    June 2025


   The parsing algorithm for a Dictionary produces a keyed collection of
   values, each with a possibly-empty set of parameters.  The parsing
   process guarantees that each key has at most one value and
   parameters.

   To obtain preferences for each of the categories in the vocabulary,
   iterate through the categories.  For the label that corresponds to
   that category (see Table 1), obtain the corresponding value from the
   collection, disregarding any parameters.  A preference is assigned as
   follows:

   *  If the value is a Token with a value of y, the associated
      preference is to allow that category of use.

   *  If the value is a Token with a value of n, the associated
      preference is to disallow that category of use.

   *  Otherwise, a preference is not expressed for that category of use.

   Note that this last alternative includes the key being absent from
   the collection, values that are not Tokens, and Token values that are
   other than y or n.  All of these are not errors, they only result in
   no preference being inferred.

   An important note about this process and format is that, if the same
   key appears multiple times, only the last value is taken.  This means
   that duplicating the same key could result in unexpected outcomes.
   For example, the following expresses no preferences:

   ai=y, ai="n", genai=n, genai, tdm=n, tdm=()

   If the parsing of the Dictionary fails, no preferences are expressed.
   This includes where keys include uppercase characters, as this format
   is case sensitive (more correctly, it operates on bytes, not
   strings).

   This process produces an abstract data structure that assigns a
   preference to each usage category as described in Section 3.

6.6.  Alternative Formats

   This format is only an exemplary way to represent preferences.  The
   model described in Section 3, can be used without this serialization.

   Any alternative format needs to define how that model is represented
   and how to generate the same model from any alternative
   representation.

7.  Consulting a Preference Expression

   After processing a preference expression (Section 6.5), an
   application can request the status of a specific usage category.

   A single preference expression can be evaluated for a usage category
   as follows:

   1.  If the expression contains an explicit preference (either to
       allow or disallow), that is the result.

   2.  Otherwise, if the usage category is a proper subset of another
       usage category, recursively apply this process to that category
       and use the result of that process.

   3.  Otherwise, no preference is expressed.

   This process results in three potential answers: allow, disallow, and
   no preference.  Applications can use the answer to guide their
   behavior.

   One approach for dealing with a "no preference" answer is to assign a
   default.  This document takes no position on what default might be
   chosen as that will depend on policy constraints beyond the scope of
   this specification.

7.1.  Combining Preferences

   The application might have multiple preference expressions, obtained
   using different methods.

   If multiple preference expressions are active, all preference
   expressions are consulted (Section 7), unless some can be discarded
   (Section 7.2).  This might result in conflicting answers.

   Absent some other means of resolving conflicts, the following process
   applies to each usage category:

   *  If any preference expression indicates that the usage is
      disallowed, the result is that the usage is disallowed.

   *  Otherwise, if any preference preference allows the usage, the
      result is that the usage is allowed.

   *  Otherwise, no preference is expressed.

   This process ensures that the most restrictive preference applies.

Internet-Draft               AI Preferences                    June 2025


7.2.  Overriding Preferences

   Any method of attaching preference expressions to assets can specify
   conditions where the preferences obtained using one method override
   those of another method.

   If an application has two preference expressions where one is defined
   as overriding the other, the overridden preference can be discarded.

8.  Security Considerations

   TODO Security

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document establishes a new standalone IANA registry entitled
   "Automated Processing Categories of Use".

   This registry operates under the "Specification Required" policy; see
   Section 4.6 of [RFC8126].

   New entries in this registry require the following information:

   Label:  A short label that meets the constraints in Section 6.1.
   Title:  A short title
   Subset Of:  The category of use that this category is a proper subset
      of.  This needs to refer to another entry in the registry by its
      label, or be the string "(none)".
   Reference:  A link to a document that contains a precise definition
      for the category of use.

   The Title and Label fields need to be separately unique across all
   items in the registry.

      |  Note that Labels are sequences of bytes in practice, but the
      |  registry lists Labels as strings, which are encoded into bytes
      |  using [ASCII].

9.1.  Initial Registry Contents

   The registry is seeded with the values in Table 2.

9.2.  Registration Guidance

   Assigned experts are responsible for ensuring that new items meet the
   technical requirements for the protocol.  This minimally includes the
   syntax restrictions on labels (Section 6.1) and the potential for
   impossible reference loops in the Subset Of field.  However, there
   are further special considerations for this registry that involve
   some exercise of discretion on the part of assigned experts.

   Expressions of preference are most effective when they have a shared
   understanding.  Keeping the limited number of items in the vocabulary
   limited is one of the best ways to ensure that there is wide
   understanding.  That means that experts are instructed to reject
   registrations if there is any doubt regarding:

   *  the scope of the proposed category of use,

   *  the relationship between the proposed category of use and existing
      categories of use, or

   *  the importance of being able to express preferences regarding the
      uses covered by the proposed category.

   This involves a degree of judgment not ordinarily asked of assigned
   experts.  Rather than expect an assigned expert to be able to resolve
   difficult cases, any case where there is doubt MUST be referred to
   the IETF to resolve.  In effect, this ensures that contested
   registration requests are elevated to require "IETF Review"; see
   Section 4.8 of [RFC8126].

   To aid in the decision-making process, new registration requests MUST
   be copied to the "aicontrol@ietf.org" list for at least three weeks
   of discussion before a decision is made.  Experts are expected to use
   input from that list to inform their decision.
